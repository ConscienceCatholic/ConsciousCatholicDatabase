# Catholic Conscience Database
## An online tool to help faithful Catholics make morally informed financial decisions

### Project Plan

The project will allow Catholics to contribute their knowledge of corporate and non-profit organizational 
cooperation with moral evils. The contributions will require reputable sources for all claims, to be reviewed 
by a select group of trusted individuals for approval. We will begin with an effort by the creator to catalogue 
data for all of the 2021 Fortune 500 Corporations, and the ~100 largest American 501c3 organizations at the close of 
2021.

Users will be able to search the website for corporations by official name or by trading symbol. 501c3s will only 
be searchable by official name. Major child companies also need to be listed on the corpoation page and searchable 
for ease of use (for example, a search for "Google" should return the page for information regarding the Alphabet 
company). Sites will list information by moral concern, giving a score of formal, direct remote, indirect remote, 
or no cooperation with that evil.

- Formal: the corporation or non-profit actively participates in the evil as part of its revenue generation or 
mission statement

- Direct Remote: the corporation or non-profit gives money to or partners with an organization that has formal 
cooperation with the evil as defined above

- Indirect Remote: the corporation or non-profit donates money or partners with an organization that has direct 
remote cooperation with the evil as defined above, or donates money to or partners with an organization already
tagged as having indirect remote cooperation with the evil

- No Cooperation: the corporation has no known formal, direct remote, or indirect remote cooperation with evil 
as defined above. The task of discovering all levels of indirect remote cooperation with evil is a large one, 
and we cannot guarantee that every organization that is categorized as a "no" has no level of remote cooperation, 
but it should be very remote if they are tagged with a no.

Maintenance of the site is expected to become a large task fairly quickly, so we may need to work with a larger
institutional structure, such as a religious order or diocese, in order to maintain the accuracy of the database to 
the best of our ability. At the very least, a review should be done of the organizations in the database semi-annually, 
and reviews of user submissions should be completed and approved or rejected within a month of their submission.
